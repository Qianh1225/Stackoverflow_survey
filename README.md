## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anacondadistribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

I am currently looking for industrial opportunities. Both data scientist and software engineer seems to be good choices for me. Nowadays data scientist seems to be the most exciting jobs.  [LinkedIn reported that the data scientist is the most promising job in 2019 with a 56% of growth in job posts.](https://blog.linkedin.com/2019/january/10/linkedins-most-promising-jobs-of-2019)   As a potential data scientist, I would like to use data to find the truth. For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow surveys from 2011 to 2019 to better understand:
1.  Is there a real upward trend of numbers of professional data scientists in the industry?
2. Who makes more money? data scientist or software engineer or data analyst?
3. Who is more satisfied with their jobs?
4. Is that true data scientist have higher demands in degree than software engineer and data analyst?
5. Which jobs are more friendly with other majors such as natural sciences?

## Data Descriptions

For this project, I used Stack Overflow surveys from 2011 to 2019, which can be downloaded in [Stack Overflowâ€™s Annual Developer Surveys](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  The surveys started from 2011 to 2019. The numbers of participants grows from 2813 in 2011 to 88883 in 2019. The surveys asked questions related to multiple aspects of jobs as a developer.

## File Descriptions

There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Another notebook *prepare_data.ipynb* is used to first clean and prepare data. There is an additional  `.py`  file that contains functions to clean and prepare data.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available:
